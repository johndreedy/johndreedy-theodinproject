Coding is rewarding but also difficult and frustrating.

* Do you want a fulfilling career with good pay?
* Is it a creative outlet for you?
* Do you want to build any app you think of?
* Do you want to start your own company with an app?

Could be any combination of these things.

Growth mindset requires persistence and grit.
Everything requires a lot of tries.
Intelligence isn't fixed but can be developed.
There will be many times during the Odin Project that you will get stuck
and will question your ability.

"Focus mode" vs "Diffuse mode"
(ie. conscious active learning vs unconscious passive learning)
Should use both to succeed - take a break sometimes.

- Understand
- Practice
- Teach

* Learning to learn, etc

* Tips
 - Google it
 - Take a break
 - Ask on the TOP Discord

ChadGPT code generation "oh no this is me :("
* LLMs and AI models like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have exploded recently
* However it's not good for code competency / core understanding
* Can result in some blind spots and gaps in knowledge

Why?
-Misses the opportunity to discover how it works
-May avoid asking good questions
-Need to be able to talk about the code one writes (especially in a job)
-Needs to be closely scrutinised in a way a beginner couldn't
-Goods supplement but needs a foundation
-Doesn't help develop problem solving skills
-Interviews could be a struggle if you can't use them

* Khan Academy has a lesson in Additional Resources on how to use AI

* TOP doesn't care but you'll cheat yourself out of learning

* Managing study is important - try to do it every day
or at least multiple times per week.
* Everyone learns at different speeds, etc etc.

* Deadlines cause too much stress

* Pitfalls
 - Procrastination
 - Lack of consistent concentration
 	- Pomodoro works for this
 - Not taking breaks

 - Go listen to music, journal, doodle, play a game, go for a walk, etc

* Lots of stuff about different distractions, etc

* Basically prepare for speedbumps
