* Before you can program, you need a rigorous / holistic view of how it works

Some questions:
* What is the internet
* What are packets
* How do packets trasnfer data
* What is a web page vs a server vs a browser, etc
* What is a client
* What is a server
* What are IP addresses
* What are DNS servers

BBC Video:

* Originally was a project by ARPANET to connect a dozen university systems together
* Facilitated research for universities in the USA via a "packet-switch network"

* First word was "Login", but crashed before G

* 1.2 million km of submarine cables; connect server buildings together

(cue title screen) THE INTERNET

How it works

* Device requests a connection
* Request goes to regional networks
* Goes to a main regional server
* Goes across the globe to where the video is stored
* Information is torn apart in what is called "packets"
* Then rearranged to create data / information

Mozilla Article 1:

* To solve all PCs needing to connect to each other, they use a router
* Similar to a signaler at a railway telling them where to go
* Computer A -> Router -> Comupter B -> Avoid computer C

* What if we have too many connections? Connect routers to routers
* Can scale infinitely

* How do you connect with anyone? By using telephone infrastructure
* Uses a piece of equipment called a modem
* This modem turns info from our router into data manageable by telephone infrastructure

* To send messages to the network we want, it connects to an internet service provider (ISP)

* To find another PC it is linked to a network with an IP address (Internet Protocol)
* Four numbers separated by dots

* IP can be made readable with a domain name

* Internet =! Web
* Internet = infrastructure
* Web = service

* Intranet can be used as a private network

Mozilla Article 2:

Web page = document that can be displayed in a browser
Website = a collection of pages grouped together
Web server = a computer that hosts the website
Search engine = a service that helps you find other pages

For example if you went to a public library you'd find the index / title of the book you want.
Then make a note of the catalogue number.
Then go to that particular section to find it.

A web page is written in HTML.
	- Style information
	- Scripts
	- Media

Mozilla Article 3: 

* Computers connect through clients and servers
	- Client sends a request, server sends a response
	- Client is typically the device itself
	- Server is a computer that stores the website
	- A copy of the server website is downloaded onto the client

* Other factors
	- Internet connection
	- TCP / IP is communication that determines how the data travels
	- DNS is domain name system that is an address book for websites
	- HTTP is hypertext transfer protocol, eg. a message for client and servers to speak
	- Component files, ie HTML, CSS and JavaScript
	- Assets such as images, music, video, etc

1. Browser goes to DNS server and finds the real address of it
2. Browser sends a HTTP request to the server asking to send a copy of the website to the client
3. If the HTTP request is approved it sends a "200" message and sends the website data in packets
4. The browser assembles the packets into a complete display

DNS = domain name system allows IP address to correspond with a HTTP address (http://www.example.com)

* Resolving name server looks up the HTTP address

* DNS is a human-readable address
* There are IPv4 and IPv6

* TLD = top-level domain
It is the general purpose of the service behind the name
For example, governments, countries, etc

You cannot buy a domain name, only rent it.
