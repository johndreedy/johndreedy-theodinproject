* Introduction to Flexbox

* There are many ways to move elements on a page

* Flexbox is a relatively new way of manipulating elements in CSS

* Some resources put it near the end of the curriculum as it's somewhat new
* However since it's the default way of positioning elements it may as well be learnt first

* Flexbox can get complicated
* Inspecting and debugging will become crucial in the following lessons
* If something is awry or not behaving correctly then inspect it every time

* Flexbox isn't more difficult but does have more moving parts
* It will be necessary to reference these lessons during assignments at the end of the section

* Let's Flex!

* Flexbox arranges items into rows and columns

* Some properties belong to the flex container, while some belong to flex items
* A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it

* An element can be both a flex container and also a flex item
* You could put display: flex on an item and then use flexbox to arrange its own children

* A flex container is what holds the flex items, whereas flex items are individual elements that populate the container
* An element is automatically a flex item if it lives inside a container
