* Different display types have different box modelsw

* You can change how a box is calculated by changing the display property

* Block vs Inline

* Most elements learnt about so far are block elements
* By default they'll appear on the page stacked on top of each other

* Inline elements don't start on a new line, they appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside
* For example a link or <a> tag
* If you put it in the middle of a paragraph it will behave like a part of it
* Generally you don't want to put extra padding or margin on inlne elements

* Inline-block is useful but generally you'll use flexbox more often

* Divs and Spans

* All other HTML elements we've encountered so far give meaning to their content
* Strong elements tell the browser which text is important
* Paragraph elements tell the browser to display text as a paragraph

* However, divs and spans give no particular meaning - they are just generic boxes

* This is much more useful than it first seems; we often need elements just to be "hook" elements
* This could mean giving an id or class to be styled via CSS
* It could also mean grouping related elements under one parent element to position on the page

* Div is a block-level element, so it is used as a container to group other elements
* It means we can divide the page into different blocks and apply styling to them

* Span is an inline element so it can be used to group text context and other inline HTML elements together

* You can change the element's display property with display: block; or display: inline-block;
