* The Box Model

* The most important skills to learn when mastering CSS is positioning and layout

* Changing fonts and colours is important but placing things where they need to be is more important

* People rush through HTML and CSS to get to JavaScript but end up missing these fundamentals

* The first important concept to be success in CSS is the box model
* Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box

* The boxes can have other boxes inside of them

* The only complication is that there are many ways to manipulate the size of these boxes and the space between them
	- padding = increases the space between the border and the content of a box
	- margin = increases the space between the borders and borders of adjacent boxes
	- border = adds space between the margin and padding

* From inside to outside, the order of box-model properties is content, padding, border, margin

* The box-sizing CSS property changes the box model mode to alternate, so the margin is the addition of all nearby elements rather than reducing the pixels

* In the alternative mode, any width is the width of the box visible on the page, minus border and padding
* No need to add things up to get the real size of the box!

* You would use margin to create more space between two elements
* You would use padding to create more space between the element contents and its border
* You would use margin (negative) for two elements to overlap with one another
