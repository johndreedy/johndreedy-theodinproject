<p></p> = New paragraph

<h1></h1>, <h2></h2>, etc = Heading (six heading tags total)

<strong></strong> = Bold text

<em></em> = "Emphasis" or italic text

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN <b> AND <strong>, OR <em> and <i>

Accessibility settings mean for people using screen readers that <strong> and <em> are much preferred.
This is because it adds strength or emphasis when voice reading as well as just visually.

<b> and <i> are fine for visual cues such as brands or names but generally should be avoided.
