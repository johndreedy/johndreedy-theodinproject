* CREATING LINKS *

<a> = Anchor element for URL
Must be used in conjunction with a link

For example:
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">Click me!</a>

Absolute links = links to pages on other websites

protocol://domain/path

https://www.theodinproject.com/about

./ is file relative to the current directory
This will often redirect to the correct pathway

* A metaphor:
town.com is a town, in which /museum is location
Each page in the website is a room of the museum
For example /museum/movie_room.html
Or /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html

Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are a direction from the current room

Absolute links are full directions including the protocol (https), or domain name (town.com)
and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html)

In total: https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html

* SHOWING IMAGES *

HTML has a wide variety of elements for different media.

Images can be shown with:
<img src="images/image.jpg" alt="An image">

The alt attribute is for when the image does not load, or to read for the visually impaired

"../images/image.jpg" would use ../ to access the parent directory

You would use a normal source for the main directory, and ../ for any sub-directories.

img tags are one of the few that don't need closing brackets.

* IMAGE TYPES *

.jpg is good for large colour palettes without large file size
.jpg does not allow for transparent pixels, however

.gif is good for simple animations but are limited in colour palette
.gif allows transparent pixels but not semi-opaque pixels

.png has a high level of detail and would be bigger than .jpg
.png would not be appropriate for large images due to size

.svg is vector based, meaning it scales to dimensions without loss of quality
.svg needs to convert text fields to outlines using your image editor
If your images contain a lot of text it can have an impact on file size.


* FILE STRUCTURE *

Generally an index.html, an img folder, a css folder, js folder, etc

All in lowercase

No spaces, because it will become %20
%20 represents a space in an encoded URL

Keep filenames descriptive so you know what they actually are

For links, the target= attribute also helps to determine where in the page it should go to.
