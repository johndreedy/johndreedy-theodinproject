* HTML and CSS work together to create everything you see on the internet
* HTML is the raw data a page is built out of - all the text, buttons, lists, etc
* CSS adds style and positions that information, gives it color, improves the visuals, etc

* HTML and CSS are not programming languages in the sense they only present information 
* They don't deal with logic
* JavaScript however is a programming language because it adds webpage functionality

* There is a lot you can do with just HTML and CSS

* HTML determines how the web page is displayed in the browser
* CSS determines how the HTML is styled
* JavaScript provides interactive elements to CSS and HTML after it has loaded

HTML = Hypertext Markup Language
CSS = Cascading Style Sheet
