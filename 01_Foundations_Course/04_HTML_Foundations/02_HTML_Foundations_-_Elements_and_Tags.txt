HTML defines the structure and content of webpages.

* Almost all elements on a HTML page consist of opening and closing tags.

* Opening is <> and defines the start of an element, for example <p>

* Closing is </> and defines where the element ends, for example </p>

* Elements are containers for content

* Some elements don't need a closing tag:

	- <br /> and <img/>
	- <br> and <img>

* These are self-closing tags

* HTML has many pre-defined tags, and it's important to use the correct tags
* This is called semantic HTML
