THE ODIN PROJECT

* TOP is an open-source project

* TOP tells you about creating and serving web content

TOP will cover:

* The internet + your PC
* GitHub dev environment
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Back end basics

By the end you should be able to differentiate between the technologies.
Silly to do server stuff without context for why it's important.

TOP pulls from all across the internet.
Should be able to answer the questions and exercises before moving on.

Also contains some projects over the duration.

Shouldn't be a pass / fail.

Stuff about non-English speakers (doesn't apply).

After completing the course you should be comfortable with web programming 
and curious to learn more.

The last lesson will give a choice between Full Stack JS and Full Stack Rails(?)

Don't skip anything!
