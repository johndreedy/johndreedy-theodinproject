# johndreedy - The Odin Project

This is my repository page for The Odin Project, a course designed for learning web and software development to a professional standard. Each project contains a README.md which outlines goals and personal reflections in more detail.

Currently included are:

* __01_Foundations_Course__ - All notes taken and learning exercises completed from the Odin Project Foundations course

* __odin-recipes__ - A food recipe website project, to demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS
